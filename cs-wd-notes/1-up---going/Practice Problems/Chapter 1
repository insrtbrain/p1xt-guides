Current code for the practice problem is return NaN..  I think it's a loop problem;

var phone_price = 199.99;
var accessory_price = 19.99;
var spending_threshold = prompt("Enter your spending limit");
var bank_balance = 399.97;
var tax_rate = 0.095;
var total;
var final_price;

while (total < spending_threshold) {
  total += phone_price;
  if (total < spending_threshold) {
    total += accessory_price;
  }
}


final_price = total + (total * tax_rate);
console.log("Your total is $" + final_price.toFixed(2));

if (final_price > bank_balance) {
  console.log("Whoops, tax is a bitch");
} else {
  console.log("Thank you!");
  bank_balance -= final_price;
}

//lets see what's left
console.log("Your balance is now $" + bank_balance.toFixed(2));
