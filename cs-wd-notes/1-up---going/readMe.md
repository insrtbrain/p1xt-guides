**Notes and thoughts on reading**

**Forward**
Premise sounds promising.  Just creating the formatting for this file makes realize **I need to learn more about git markdown.**

**Chapter 1**

*Executing a Program*
First mention of the difference between an interpreter and a compiler.  Does Git have spellcheck?  **Further research of the differences and variations will be helpful**

*First Problem* I need to reconfigure my order of thinking.  I solve it in orde of the steps that are to be taken.  It would be more helpful to address functions (like calculating tax and printing) first, before I hit the specific situational issues.
